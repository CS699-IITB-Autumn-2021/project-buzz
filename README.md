#Problem Statement or Motivation.
As we experienced that it gets difficult for someone new to arrange essential items when they are allotted hostel, Also for others who are living in campus it still gets difficult to arrange things that they want. Many people are there who wants to sell something and many are there who wants to buy those things. Create a web application which will bridge this gap between buyers and sellers inside campus in more convenient way than before.
